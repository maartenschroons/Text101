    You remember you found a key earlier and try it on the lock.

    It opened!

    You open the door as you get blinded by the sudden income of bright light of the
    sun.

    Once the door has fully been opened, you see no sign of life except for the creature
    that was with you in the room.

    It does not look like anyhting you''ve seen before. A bronze colored rodent with
    fangs too big for such a small thing. Thank god I didn''t get bitten by it!

    The only standing building in the surrounding area is the room you were kept in...
