    about the fact you'll be stuck here forever unless you can get out of this room.

    the door and fall over. \nWhen your rage ends you notice you hit the door too
    hard and you broke some bones. \nYou fall unconscious from the pain and you never
    wake up\n\nYou are dead.\n\nPress 1 to play again!\nPress 2 to go the main menu"
